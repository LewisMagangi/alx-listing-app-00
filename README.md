# ALX Listing App 01

A modern Airbnb clone built with Next.js, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS. This project creates a scalable foundation for a property listing platform with reusable components and clean architecture.

## Project Goals

The ALX Listing App aims to:

- Create a responsive and user-friendly property listing interface
- Implement modern web development practices with TypeScript
- Build reusable and modular components for scalability
- Establish a clean, maintainable codebase structure
- Provide an excellent user experience for property browsing and booking

### Directory Purposes

- **`components/`**: Contains all reusable UI components organized by category. The `common/` subdirectory holds components used throughout the application.

- **`interfaces/`**: TypeScript interface definitions that ensure type safety and code consistency across the project.

- **`constants/`**: Centralized location for application constants, API configurations, and validation rules to maintain consistency.

- **`public/assets/`**: Static assets including images, icons, and other media files organized for easy access and maintenance.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js 15+**: React framework with Pages Router for server-side rendering and optimal performance
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe JavaScript for better development experience and code reliability
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development
- **ESLint**: Code linting for maintaining code quality and consistency

## Getting Started
